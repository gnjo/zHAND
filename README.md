zHAND&lt;> DNAHz : data press theory, use dna rule and sampling theory

## DNA rule
DNA is 2bit system. 4 values, ATGC.  
DNA is 2pattern system. Base pair A/T and G/C only.  
DNA have the rule, if lost the pair, must decide the one. ```ex) A/T lost T is re-pair the A.```

By the way, mean the lost on DATA? panic data?  
No.   
Answer, the press-ed data on DNA rule.   

if half cut data - like a single DNA - to repair the original data, depend the new press theory.   
ZIP what? this theory press rate base the 50%.

## press rate method
A+B=100%, A+f(B)=50% + f(B). (if f(B)<50% mean the press-ed)
```ex) 100GB =>zHAND=> 50GB + f(B)```

## f(B) to original. how to do? use sampling theroy

press nest can be possible.
